You may not (automatically or manually) collect information distributed through FreeStuff or the FreeStuff bot for anything other than private use. If do you have an automated way to collect Data sent through the bot, the [5. FreeStuff API] paragraph of this ToS applies to you and you do need to get an API key to be allowed to use the Data collected.

FreeStuff keeps the right to immediately and without further notice or reason remove the Bot from your Discord Server and/or delete all of the associated Data. FreeStuff keeps the right to exclude you from current and future use of the Bot and associated Services for reasons like, but not limited to: ToS infractions or Copyright issues.

## 4. Management Platform

You may use the Management Platform ("MP" or "Platform") in its entirety accessible to you. You may not use or try to use the Platform for anything other than what you were given access to. For instance if you were given access to the Platform to translate the bot, you may not try to interact with the API settings pages or associated content.

You are not allowed to share your access to the MP with anyone else. The only exception to this are your legal guardians if you are under the age of 18.

You may not use the MP for malicious actions. This includes but is not limited to: Using the Platform to harm other users in any way possible or using the Platform to cause harm to FreeStuff or it's affiliates.

### 5.1 Your right to use the API

The API can mainly be used to access information about current deals and offers, as well as general information about computer games or software. In order to interact with the API, you will need to acquire and use an API Key (which goes beyond the scope of this Policy). Without an API Key given out by FreeStuff you may not interact (or try to interact) with the API.
