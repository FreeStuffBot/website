## 1. About Activities

Most FreeStuff Activities will be hosted on the official FreeStuff Discord server. A link to join can be found at the bottom of the page. Some Activities might be hosted on other platforms or in cooperation with other Organizations where extra terms or policies might apply. More information will be provided if that is the case.
FreeStuff does not commit to hosting Activities on a regular basis. FreeStuff keeps the right to cancel any future Activities, publicly announced or not, without any reason or justification.

## 2. Participation

Your may participate in all public FreeStuff Activities where no limitation on participating is announced. FreeStuff keeps the right to exclude you from any current or future giveaways for reasons including, but not limited to: Terms of Service, Giveaway, or server rule violations.

## 3. Winning

The following paragraph is directed at Activities with a single winner. However this policy also applies to Activities with multiple winners in it's full entirety and without any differences.

FreeStuff tries to fulfill the promised price in it's entirety and full scope, however outside factors might not allow so. For instance living in a US foreign trade regulated country might make you ineligible to win. In that case or similar scenarios FreeStuff is not required to deliver the price in it's full scope or even at all. Furthermore FreeStuff remains the right to cancel any Activity at any point in time, including after a winner was chosen, without providing a reason or justification, including cancelling the price in it's entirety or change the price to something other than originally announced. Additionally FreeStuff may at any point in time, after a winner was chosen, change the winner to someone else without providing any reason.

If you have won an Activity and did not receive your price you have the right to know why. Please use the contact information below in that case.

## 4. Contact

Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or other concerns regarding this policy.
